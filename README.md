# Spray UI

A simple UI library made by lu2000luk with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS.

## How to use

Go into `src/lib/components` to find every single component, then find the one you need and integrate it in your application.

## Colors

Your application should use the following settings in the `tailwind.config.ts` file:

```ts
colors: {
   'text': [],
   'background': [],
   'primary': [],
   'secondary': [],
   'accent': [],
},
```

As those colors are used in the components.

## Fonts

The font used in the website is `Azeret Mono` from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Azeret+Mono).
If you want to use these components a font like this should be the best one to use for a better UI.
